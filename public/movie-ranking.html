<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>
In a world where science pushes the boundaries of nature...
A visionary billionaire creates a theme park like no other — Jurassic Park. On a remote island, dinosaurs roam the earth once more, brought to life by cutting-edge genetic engineering.
But when an elite group of experts and a curious pair of kids are invited to preview the park, what begins as a dream quickly turns into a nightmare.
The power goes out. The cages are unlocked. And now, the hunters... become the hunted.
From director Steven Spielberg, Jurassic Park is a heart-pounding adventure where survival is no longer about man versus man — it's about man versus the might of prehistory.
Hold onto your butts. The dinosaurs are back.
